      <h1>A Rundown of The Neighbourhood</h1>
      <p id="first-paragraph">So, who are the people that make up The Neighbourhood? The lead singer and face of the band is Jesse Rutherford. He has a striking, edgy demeanor that perfectly represents the essence of The Neighbourhood. Rutherford’s style shines especially in the band’s most recent album, “Chip Chrome & the Mono-Tones.”</p>
      <p>Alongside Rutherford, the band is also made up of guitarists Jeremey Freedman and Zach Abels, bassist Mikey Margott and drummer Brandon Alexander Fried. Altogether, The Neighbourhood is composed of five guys from California who have been pushing the boundaries of music for about 10 years.</p>
      <p>The group’s five greatest hits on Spotify are “Sweater Weather,” “Daddy Issues,” “Afraid,” “Stargazing” and “The Beach.” Anyone who has heard of The Neighbourhood has almost certainly heard of “Sweater Weather.” With over one billion listens on Spotify, despite being one of their oldest songs, it’s the band’s greatest hit by far. While “Sweater Weather” — which is from the group’s debut album, “I Love You.” — is a classic, The Neighbourhood still has so much more to offer.</p>

      <h1>The Albums and Songs That Make The Neighbourhood a Remarkable Band</h1>
      <p id="first-paragraph">Some personal suggestions for taste-testing The Neighbourhood include “Everybody’s Watching Me (Uh Oh),” “W.D.Y.W.F.M?” and “Afraid,” each of which is from “I Love You.” Overall, “I Love You.” is a beautiful, gloomy album that should be listened to all the way through. That being said, the songs listed are some of the highlights — particularly “Afraid,” a personal favorite of mine. Alongside rhythmic, dark-rock music, Rutherford sings about the fear of abandonment and irrelevancy, which is something many people can relate to.</p>
      <p>Come 2014 and The Neighbourhood has released their first mixtape with an eye-catching name, “#000000 & #FFFFFF.” Try saying that album name aloud — it’s a doozy. Even something like this completely alien mixtape title reveals the distinct, not-giving-a-hoot mentality of The Neighbourhood. They’re not afraid to stand out and be themselves.</p>
      <p>“#000000 & #FFFFFF” is where The Neighbourhood’s R&B inspirations and vibes really shine through. Alongside an impressive list of feature guests like G-Eazy and French Montana, The Neighbourhood proves their ability to mesh their indie-rock style with R&B. For example, alongside their usual emo, dark-rock sounds, Rutherford dives into rapping, and the combination works beautifully. Some shining songs include “Lurk,”“#icanteven” and “1 of those Weaks.”</p>
      <p>In 2015, The Neighbourhood dropped their third album, “Wiped Out!” This collection contains some of The Neighbourhood’s most legendary and experimental music yet. The six-year-old album brings some breathtaking songs like “Daddy Issues,” “R.I.P. 2 My Youth” and “Wiped Out!” With these songs, The Neighbourhood’s lyrics reach a new level of quality. While each song has always featured beautiful, meticulously crafted lyrics that speak on love, lust, existential crises and the superficiality of society, the songs on “Wiped Out!” evoke both heartbreak and catharsis.</p>
